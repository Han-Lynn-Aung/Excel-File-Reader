# Excel-File-Reader

#This code is a Java program that allows a user to browse for an Excel file, read the data from the file, and import it into a MySQL database. The program uses the Apache POI library to read Excel files, and the JDBC driver to connect to a MySQL database.

#The program creates a GUI using Java's Swing library. The GUI consists of a JFrame with a JLabel, two JButtons, and a JTextArea. The JLabel displays the name of the selected Excel file, and the two buttons allow the user to browse for a file and import data. The JTextArea displays the program's progress and any error messages.

#The importData() method reads the data from the selected Excel file and inserts it into the MySQL database. It first establishes a connection to the database using the JDBC driver. It then iterates through the rows of the Excel sheet and extracts the data from each row. The data is checked for validity and duplicates before being inserted into the database using prepared statements.

#Overall, this program provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for importing data from an Excel file into a MySQL database using Java. However, it is important to note that the code may require modification to suit specific use cases and requirements. Additionally, it is recommended to thoroughly test the program and handle any potential errors that may occur during the data import process.
